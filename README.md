Smart Hint is a Chrome Extension that integrates with competitive programming platforms like LeetCode and
Codeforces to deliver step-by-step AI-generated hints and conceptual explanations without exposing the
direct solution. It leverages the OpenAI API to provide dynamic, context-aware support based on the
problem currently being solved. The extension includes a lightweight frontend built with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, and a Node.js backend hosted on Render. It features automatic problem detection using DOM
parsing, an intuitive popup interface, and an option for on-demand explanations. Designed to support both
beginner and advanced programmers, the tool boosts independent problem-solving while maintaining
learning integrity.
